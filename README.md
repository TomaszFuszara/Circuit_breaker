# Circuit_breaker

Circuit breaker was device designed to help me with performing Automotive tests. Some of tests demanded very fast swithing on and switching of he power. AVR was controlling transistors responsible for stopping and enabling current flow from power supply to device under test. 2 LEDs were indicating states:
- green one was indicating active state of transistors
- red one was indicating cut-of state of transistors
